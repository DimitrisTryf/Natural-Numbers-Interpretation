# Natural-Numbers-Interpretation

When interacting with an automated dialogue system, the caller is often required to provide his phone
number. Phone numbers may be uttered in many ways with different digit groupings (e.g. 2106930664 may
be uttered as "210 69 30 6 6 4" or "210 69 664" etc). Furthermore, speech input may cause ambiguities. For
example, if the caller says "twentyfive" this could be transcribed as "25" or "20 5".
This application deals with some of these issues.
